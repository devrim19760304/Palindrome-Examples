# Palindrome Checker

## What is palindrome 
```bash
What is a palindrome, and what does it mean?
A palindrome is a word, sentence, verse, or even number that reads the same backward or forward. It derives from Greek roots that literally mean “running back” (palin is “again, back,” and dromos, “running.”) The word appears to have been created in English based on these roots in the early 1600s.

## about app 
This small js function determines if the input text is a palindrome—a sequence that reads the same backward as forward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization. Users simply enter a phrase, click "Check", and the program quickly analyzes and displays whether the input is a palindrome or not. It's a handy tool for language enthusiasts and curious minds alike.
I used an easy CSS and HTML.
